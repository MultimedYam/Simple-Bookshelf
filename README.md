Simple Minecraft Spigot Bookshelf Plugin

This is a simple Minecraft Spigot bookshelving plugin I made in about 2 days.
For my first time back to Java in 5 years and the first time making a plugin for a Minecraft framework, it works pretty well.

There are some obvious flaws i.e. database code is not asynchronous, so usage may not scale well.
Regardless, pretty proud that I figured it out and it works in the first place.
